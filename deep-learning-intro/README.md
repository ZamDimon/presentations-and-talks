## üì∞ Content

Presentation in `.pdf` format can be found in the [`presentation.pdf`](presentation.pdf) file.

The training and testing is provided in the [`digit_recognition.ipynb`](digit_recognition.ipynb) file. Certain helper functions were used from the [`utils.py`](utils.py) file.

If you want to see source materials for the presentation, see [`tex-source`](tex-source) folder.

## ‚ùî I want to play around in the Jupyter Notebook: what do I do?

1. Install [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/install/)
2. Create an environment with the required packages installed (it does not matter what versions you choose):

- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

To install them via a single line, write

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the [`digit_recognition.ipynb`](digit_recognition.ipynb) and play around however you want :)
